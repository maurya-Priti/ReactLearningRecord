SPA
-Single Page Application
-website or web application that rewrites the current page(dynamically) instead of reloading the entire web application, reducing the server requests.
- improved application performace(fast reloading and cut downs lag time between successive pages), reduced developement time, lower infrastructure costs.

Initially working with SPA was very tedious, and required heavy-coding. Also it was difficult to mange content within such applications.
Content management systems were introduced.

In SPAs, instead of reloading entire web pages, only those part of the web page is reloaded which is updated dynamically.
ex. header, footer and sidebar of webpage remains same throughout application, and those are not reloaded everytime from server.

Advantages of SPA:
-HTML,CSS,JS files are loaded from server only once.
-Reduced traffic on server i.e. no more queires to the server.
-Fast and responsive front-end building
-Enhanced user experience


React is used to develop single page applications
